## Personal Development
I currently work mainly with React (ES6). Durham’s CS degree covered Python, OOLs (C++, Java, C#), MySQL, Prolog and Haskell. 

Design is really important to me, and this feeds through into my engineering approach. I’m self-taught fluent using most of Adobe CS, and am competent with wire-framing tools (Sketch, Origami). I also dabble in typography (@handtypedproject).

I love running (just did my first half-marathon), rock climbing (Secretary of my college climbing society), Judo, and dancing (1st place Novice on university circuit, Treasurer of Durham’s Dancesport Team). I was a member of my college Hockey and rowing teams. I‘m singer and multi-instrumentalist and joined several bands and choirs at university.
