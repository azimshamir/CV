<hr class="full-width"/> <h2 id="üí°-5-problems-ive-solved">üí° 5 problems I&#39;ve solved</h2>
<ol>
<li>A federation of 40+ London GP practices were restricted by <strong>NHS</strong> regulation and struggling with collaboration, communication, and project governance. Based on thorough requirement gathering, and through a 3-phase build, I delivered a bespoke private network and project management tool, only retired when the NHS rolled out MS Office in 2020.</li>
<li><strong>Arsenal FC</strong> were looking to efficiently record and report match-day injuries. They thought they needed a bespoke data gathering and reporting system; in half a day I created a simple workflow using free tools which transformed their process and they still use today.</li>
<li>After being let down by a previous agency, <strong>Cityboard</strong> had a barely functioning iOS-only app and little runway. Under tight time and budget constraints, I designed and delivered a <a href="https://portfolio.mcclowes.co">beautiful, cross-platform MVP</a> with (at the time) brand-new technology React Native.</li>
<li><strong>The Business of Cities</strong> needed a way or aggregating and analyzing indexes for their clients. Through novel use of the Elo rating algorithm, I created a methodology &amp; tool which is <em>&quot;critical to their work&quot;</em>, providing insight to <a href="https://www.thebusinessofcities.com/partners">cities across the world</a>.</li>
<li>While working a saturday job <strong>Godfreys.co</strong> butchers, I saw that the traditional store was in need of an online presence, was trusted with a business rebrand, &amp; designed and delivered an <a href="https://portfolio.mcclowes.co">award-winning eCommerce website</a> that now brings in 30% of their revenue.</li>
