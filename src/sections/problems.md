## ðŸ’¡ 5 problems I've solved

1. A federation of 40+ London GP practices were restricted by __NHS__ regulation and struggling with collaboration, communication, and project governance. In 2016, after thorough requirement gathering and a 3-phase build, I delivered a bespoke private network and project management tool. It was only retired when the NHS rolled out MS Office in 2020.
2. __Arsenal FC__ were looking to efficiently record and report match-day injuries. They thought they needed a bespoke data gathering and reporting system; in half a day I created a simple workflow using free tools, which transformed their process and they still use today.
3. After being let down by a previous agency, travel-guide startup __Cityboard__ had a barely-functioning iOS-only app, and little runway. Under tight time and budget constraints, I designed and delivered a beautiful, cross-platform MVP with newly-launched React Native.
4. Think-tank __The Business of Cities__ needed a way or aggregating and analyzing indexes for their clients. Through novel use of the Elo rating algorithm, I created a methodology and tool which is _"critical to their work"_, providing insight to [cities across the world](https://www.thebusinessofcities.com/partners).
5. Premium butchers __Godfreys.co__ had queues round the block and no online presence. I designed and delivered a complete rebrand and [award-winning eCommerce website](https://portfolio.mcclowes.co), that now brings in 30% of their revenue.
